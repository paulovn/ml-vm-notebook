Note that merely closing the window does **not** terminate the kernel: it keeps running in the background (and opening the Notebook again can continue intraaction).\n",
    "2. Increase the RAM assigned to the virtual machine running the notebooks. This can be adjusted in the `Vagrantfile` and is 2 GB by default"
